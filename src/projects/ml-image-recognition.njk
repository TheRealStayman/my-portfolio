        <p>
            This machine learning system can identify and classify objects in images with high accuracy. Leveraging deep learning techniques and a custom-trained convolutional neural network, the system can recognize over 1,000 different object categories in real-time, even in challenging lighting conditions or with partial occlusion.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project began as a research initiative to improve image classification for accessibility applications, but has evolved into a versatile system that can be deployed in various contexts from retail inventory management to assistive technology for visually impaired users.

        <h2 class="project-section-title">Technical Details</h2>
        <p>
            The core model is based on a modified EfficientNet architecture, trained on a combined dataset of ImageNet and custom-collected images. Data augmentation techniques were extensively used to improve model robustness, including random cropping, rotation, color jittering, and mixup.
        </p>
        <p>
            Model training was performed using PyTorch on a multi-GPU setup, with hyperparameter optimization via Bayesian search. For deployment, TensorFlow Lite and ONNX Runtime are used to optimize performance across different platforms. The system includes a custom inference engine that can process up to 60 frames per second on modern hardware.
        </p>
        <p>
            To ensure privacy, all image processing is performed locally on the user's device by default, though cloud processing options are available for more compute-intensive tasks.

        <h2 class="project-section-title">Research Paper</h2>
        <p>
            The research findings and technical approach were published in the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2023. The paper, titled "Efficient Multi-Context Object Recognition for Resource-Constrained Environments," details the architectural innovations and training methodology.
