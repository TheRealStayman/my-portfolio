        <p>
            The game was developed using Unity 2022.2, with C# for all gameplay programming. Custom shaders were written in HLSL to achieve the unique visual effects, particularly for the time-manipulation mechanics. The game features a modular architecture with a custom state machine for character control, allowing for easy expansion of abilities and movement options.
        </p>
        <p>
            All artwork was created using Aseprite for pixel art and animations, while audio was composed using FL Studio and integrated with FMOD for dynamic audio transitions based on gameplay state.
